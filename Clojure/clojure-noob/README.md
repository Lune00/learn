# Basics

Clojure is a Lisp dialect.

Java program clojure.jar reads Clojure source code and produces Java ByteCode

Java bytecode is then executed by the same JVM process already running clojure.jar

Clojure source code --- text --- > clojure.jar (compiler/Reader) ---> JVM bytecode -----> JVM (execute)
